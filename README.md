PROJECT: TEXT-TO-IMAGE GENERATOR APPLICATION

Objective:

The objective of the text-to-image generator application project is to create a software tool that generates images based on textual descriptions provided by users. This application aims to facilitate creative content generation, visual storytelling, and conceptual prototyping by converting textual prompts into visual representations.

Key Activities:

Text Input Interface: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to accept and display text input from users.

Image Generation Model Integration: Integrate a pre-trained deep learning based Stable Diffusion model from hugging face capable of generating images from text descriptions.

Image Generation: Utilize the integrated model to convert processed text prompts into visually coherent images.

Image Display: Display the generated images within the application interface using PIL (Python Imaging Library) or similar libraries.

User Interaction: Enable users to interact with the generated images, potentially allowing for adjustments or refinements of text prompts.
